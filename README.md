Exercise on Linear Regression
The here shown LinearRegression project aims to apply learned concept from course "Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp" with Jose Portilla. The exercise aims to provide a data based decision on where should a company apply it efforts in order to raise clients Yearly Amount spent, by investing in AppTime or Time on Website. Data visualisation is made with seaborn library, data work with pandas library, math with numpy and machine learning with sklearn. features were evaluated and shown. The dataset was splitten in two, so there could be a train sample and a test one. The predictions made were evaluated by the sum of squares (RÂ²). The coefficients showed that Time on App had a greater influence on yearly Amount spent. These could lead to the conclusion that the company should invest on keeping its client on App for grater time but also shows that there is room for growth sale by the website.
